## Reflections

The course was very informative and well structured. I liked that it presented both theoretical and practical aspects of TypeScript. The theory helped me to understand the basics of the language and the practice helped me to consolidate my knowledge. I learned some things I didn't know before about TypeScript.

**1. Getting Started with TypeScript:**
In this module, I was introduced to the basics of TypeScript

**2. Declare Variable Types in TypeScript:**
I learned about different data types like primitive types, composite types, interface types, class types, etc.

**3. Implement Interfaces in TypeScript:**
In this module, I explored what interfaces are in TypeScript, how to create and use them.

**4. Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript:**
In this module, I explored various aspects of functions in TypeScript such as parameters, return values, function types

**5. Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript:**
In this module, I learned the basics of OOP in TypeScript, such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and inheritance. I learned how to use classes.

**6. Generics in TypeScript:**
In this module, I learned what generics are in TypeScript, how to create and use them. I also learned about the benefits of using generics.

**7. Work with External Libraries in TypeScript:**
I learned how to work with external libraries in TypeScript. I learned about the advantages of using package managers to manage dependencies.

**8. Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript:**
I learned what namespaces are in TypeScript and how to create and use them. I learned about the advantages of using namespaces to organize code.
