# Task "Async Race"
Your customer has an idea to spend his money. He has hired some engineers who installed radio-controlled equipment ðŸ“» in real cars ðŸš—, to be precise, all of his collection of cars. He is eager to create a kind of drag-racing competition in order to discover which car is the fastest.

Each radio controller has an HTTP-compatible interface. It lets you start or stop the engine of the car and, of course, enable "driving" mode.

Your task is to create a SPA to manage the collection of cars, operate their engines, and show race statistics.

Previously, development of this application had been started by a Belarusian developer named Dzmitry (and was almost finished). However, his laptop ðŸ’» was stolen by bad guys. Unfortunately, we don't have any sources of UI ðŸ˜ž. Additionally, he had stored the server mock in his [repo](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api).

We found in the latest news that a new company called "The Fast and the Furious" announced the release of a new product that will really blow people's minds. There isn't a lot of information about this product. All we know is that it's about "easier car management than you can imagine." It's exactly what our thieves ðŸ¦¹ are up to. They're going to release their product in two weeks. But we can't allow them to do that. We must be first.

What are you waiting for? Let's start coding!
